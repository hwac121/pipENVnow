You need to open this inside the diretory you will be using it.

The venv working space name will only be available for the session.
Once you quit this application the variable holding the workspace
name will be lost and you will need to start over.

If you need to start over be sure to remove the previous workspace
directory.

When you create a new venv workspace this script also creates a new
script inside the working directory to re-activate and deactivate
the venv anytime you need to run the program it was used for. This
is made custom for each individual program.

Script created: pip-activate.sh

Run this before running the program it was used for or the program
will not run properly.
