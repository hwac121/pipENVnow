# pipENVnow
A utiity to easily setup and use the new pip venv system for applications.

1. Open this utility from the working directory in terminal using "pipenvnow"
2. Start with option 1, then 2, and so on.
3. During option 1 the setup will also create a new launcher script in the working directory called pip-activate.sh
4. The pip-activate.sh script will be used from that point on each time you want to run the program. It will enable you to easily activate the special venv and deactivate it when you are done.

This script is tested on Kali Linux and Parrot Security OS ONLY. It is possible to run on most any Debian OS
but has not been tested in any other OS as of yet.

If you run into any issue with the script please just report it in issues and I will look into the problem asap.

NOTE: I realize the new python venv method can be a pain, even though ti does have great benefits, so I made this
script to make the whole process a tad easier for folks running into program installs breaking from this new feature
they have introduced. This should take the pain out of it for you and make things a little easier all around.

Feel free to use, modify, etc. all or part of this script application for your own use. All I ask is to please give
me credits as the original author somewhere in the comments of your application.
